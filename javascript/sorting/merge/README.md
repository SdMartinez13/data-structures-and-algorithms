# Merge Sort-Code challenge 27

## Challenge Summary

- Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

- Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Merge Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

## Approach and Efficiency

- worked with [Junyoung Son](https://github.com/Junyoungson808)
- help understanding from this [Link](https://stackabuse.com/merge-sort-in-javascript/)

## Solution

- split list into two halves
- continue dividing the same way until left with single element arrays
- sort single element arrays and merge into sorted array until you have one sorted array
- return solution of array with elements in this case numbers sorted from lowest to highest
