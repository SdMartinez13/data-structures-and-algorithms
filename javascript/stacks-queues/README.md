# Stacks & Queues

## Author: Stephen Martinez

## Challenge

* Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue classes. Create a Node class that has required properties.

## Approach & Efficiency

* Linked list are efficient for inserting when inserting to the front or end of a list is required. When building the push/enqueue methods, use a time complexity of O(1). Utilize a back pointer in the Queue class to make enqueueing and dequeueing more efficient.

# Stacks & Queues Pseudo

## Challenge

* Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

# Animal Shelter

## Challenge

* FIFO Cat/Dog animal shelter

## Approach and Efficiency

* white boarded the problem domain and attempted psuedo/code using what I learned from the previous code challenges

# Stacks and Queues-Brackets

## Author: Stephen Martinez & [Jun(Junyoung Son)](https://github.com/Junyoungson808)

## Whiteboard Process

![Brackets](/assets/brackets.png)

## Challenge

* Write a function called validate brackets
* Arguments: string
* Return: boolean
  * representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced

## Approach & Efficiency

* we went with miro for the whiteboard where we were both able to contribute to the challenge.  We had to utilize google to help with the solution so we could properly draw out a white board

## Solution

* we used a for loop it iterate through the stack to determine if the brackets matched or not and returned a boolean.
