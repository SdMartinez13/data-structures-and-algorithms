# Stacks & Queues

## Author: Stephen Martinez

## Challenge

* Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue classes. Create a Node class that has required properties.

## Approach & Efficiency

* Linked list are efficient for inserting when inserting to the front or end of a list is required. When building the push/enqueue methods, use a time complexity of O(1). Utilize a back pointer in the Queue class to make enqueueing and dequeueing more efficient.
