# Tree Fizz Buzz Code Challenge 18

## Authors

* [Stephen Martinez](https://github.com/SdMartinez13)
* [Robert Ball](https://github.com/RDBALL)

* Feature tasks

  * Write a function called fizz buzz tree
  * Arguments: k-ary tree
  * Return: new k-ary tree

* Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

  * If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
  * If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
  * If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
  * If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
