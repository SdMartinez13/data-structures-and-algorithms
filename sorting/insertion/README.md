# Insertion Sort-Code Challenge 26

## Challenge Summary
- Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

- Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Insertion Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

## Approach and Efficiency

- I attempted to pair program the code challenge, I watched a video on youtube and read through various questions and answers on stackoverflow.  i wrote out what thought made the most sense to me.   as stated in the reading the big O is O(n^2)/O(1)

## Solution

how I believe this works is as you traverse through  the array each index is compared to the next number if it is lower than the current number it is now the lowest number in the array.  once it's gone though the array, it will be sorted from lowest to highest.
