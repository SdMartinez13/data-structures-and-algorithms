#### **Code Challenge 01 Reverse an Array**

---

- Write a function called `reverseArray` which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

#### Whiteboard Process

#### Approach and Efficiency

- Today was a group code challenge completed by our instructor, [Ryan Gallaway](https://github.com/rkgallaway).  It was my first experience with whiteboarding, and I really appreciated the instruction.  The whiteboard provided above was done entirely by Mr. Gallaway during instruction.

#### **Code Challenge 02 Array Insert Shift**

---

- Write a function called `insertShiftArray` which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

#### Whiteboard Process

#### Approach and Efficiency

- Today I worked with [Brandon Pitts](https://github.com/brandomoki) on the the code challenge.  We started the challenge with coding out in replit using a a for-loop to iterate through the array, it insert an elenemt into the middle of the array.  We then worked though the whiteboard process.  Being our first time doing this I think we worked well together getting through the asignment.  We spent more time than we expected, but being the first time for both of of us, I think we made the most of our time.

#### **Code Challenge 03 Binary Search**

---

- Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

#### Approach and Effecientcy

- Today I worked with [Stephanie Hill](https://github.com/stephnitis) and [Mandela Steele-Dadzie](https://github.com/msteeledadzie422) on the Binary Search Code Challenge.  We started of by deciding to use Miro as our whiteboard, which Stephanie worked out for the team.  Next went went over the assignment instrcuctions and began working through our white board following the example given to us in the assignment. Once we got to the psuedo or code section we diced to put both buecause we weren't entirely sure our code was correct.  Working in a team of 3 was helpful because there were more ideas being thrown around and that was helpful.  Stephanie and Mandela were great and very knowledgeable.
