#### **Code Challenge 01 Reverse an Array**

- Write a function called `reverseArray` which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

#### Whiteboard Process

#### Approach and Efficiency

- Today was a group code challenge completed by our instructor, [Ryan Gallaway](https://github.com/rkgallaway).  It was my first experience with whiteboarding, and I really appreciated the instruction.  The whiteboard provided above was done entirely by Mr. Gallaway during instruction.

#### **Code Challenge 02 Array Insert Shift**

- Write a function called `insertShiftArray` which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

#### Whiteboard Process

#### Approach and Efficiency

- Today I worked with [Brandon Pitts](https://github.com/brandomoki) on the the code challenge.  We started the challenge with coding out in replit using a a for-loop to iterate through the array, it insert an elenemt into the middle of the array.  We then worked though the whiteboard process.  Being our first time doing this I think we worked well together getting through the asignment.  We spent more time than we expected, but being the first time for both of of us, I think we made the most of our time.
